# Spanish Language Learning Chrome Extension for Efficient Word Search

## Extension using JS and HTML that helps the user optimize vocabulary flashcard creation by opening various resources in one click.

This project was designed to expedite the flashcard creation process for new words in a target language. Gabriel Wyner's _Fluent Forever_ methodology for learning a new language is brilliant, but without this extension, the process of creating a flashcard for a new word would take much longer.
